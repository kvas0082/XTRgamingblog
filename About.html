"My name is Keerthivas BH, having finished <em>Bachelor of Technology</em> in Information Technology<br>
I am the developer of this Website. This Website means a lot to myself, because this is the first ever<br>
website that I have created with an intention to learn a new skill and enhance it into my career goals.<br>
Web-development was actually not in my cards until this year when I was quite interested in UI/UX design<br>
and that's when I started off with the fundamentals of web-designing, Finally ended up by designing this<br>
website. This Website will further be updated as I learn new key add-up skills. Eventhough this seems like<br>
a small effort I hope this website will encourage many of you to learn Web-development. If there are any flaws<br>
or something which needs to be added or changed which will make this Website even more better, Please do send<br>
me a message through the "CONTACT US" form. To know further about me <em>CLICK</em> the linkedin Icon below."</h2>
